All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A:

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: 

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: 

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

LinkedListDeque:

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A:

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: get() 方法我利用 cnt + while 循环来遍历链表，更优雅的做法是利用 for 循环。

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: printDeque() 不要调用 get()，而是边遍历边打印。

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: 一些 java 基础，比如内部类、类的定义等。

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: 判断中优先处理特殊情况

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: 暂时没有。
